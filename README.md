**PepperApp** is my capstone project for Code Kentucky's Software Development Course 2.
This application was developed to help me manage information about hot peppers and their Scoville Heat Unit ratings.
I grow hot peppers and make hot sauce and other pepper products and am constantly seeking out this information from various sources.
PepperApp helps me quickly recall, update and maintain this data.
